Copy the File "pizypwm.py" and "Servo.py" in the same Folder.
When starting the Program "Servo.py", the Program will ask you for the move direction (left = l, right = r, middle = m).
If you choose "l" or "r" you have to tell him the number of steps for the Servo.

The Servo is connected to Pin 26 of Connector P1.

NOTE: You need the RPi.GPIO Python Libary for this Program.
